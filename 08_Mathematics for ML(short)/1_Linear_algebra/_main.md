# Linear Algebra
Study of vectors and rules to manipulate them

# Vectors
vectors are mathematical objects that represent a quantity with both magnitude and direction. From an abstract standpoint, any object that supports vector addition and scalar mulitplication is a vector.

# System of Linear Equations
- 2 way to express it:
  - Row form: as A@x = b
  - Column form: as x1@col1 + x2@col2 + ... = b

- A@x is the combinations of the columns of A.
