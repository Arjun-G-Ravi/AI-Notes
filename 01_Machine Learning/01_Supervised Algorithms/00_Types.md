# Supervised Algorithms

Supervised algorithms are a type of machine learning algorithm that learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. They are of two types - Regression and Classification.

## Regression
Regression algorithms are used when the target variable we want to predict is continuous.

## Classification
Classification algorithms are used when the target variable we want to predict is discrete or categorical. 

### Generative and Discriminative Classifiers
Classification algorithms are of two types - Generative and Discriminative. 

`Generative classifiers focus on modeling the underlying data distributions.` One advantage of generative classifiers is that they can provide insights into the underlying distributions of the data, which can be useful for exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing.
Eg: Naive bayes, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis, Hidden Markov Models, etc.

`Discriminative classifiers focus on finding decision boundaries that separate the classes.` They tend to perform better than generative classifiers in terms of prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or complex relationships between variables.
Eg: Logistic regression, SVM, trees, NN, etc
