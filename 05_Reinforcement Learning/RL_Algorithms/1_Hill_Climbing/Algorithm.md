# Algorithm
1. Initialize a random solution (policy).
2. Evaluate the solution.
3. Generate a set of neighboring solutions by making small changes to the current solution.
4. Evaluate each neighboring solution.
5. If any neighboring solution is better than the current solution, move to that solution.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until no better neighboring solution is found.
