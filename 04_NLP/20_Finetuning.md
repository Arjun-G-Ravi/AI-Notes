# Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is the process of adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to fit a specific task or dataset. The goal is to `adapt the model to the specific task or dataset`, while leveraging the knowledge and features learned from the pre-training process.

- This lets us take pretrained models good at general things, and make them super good on a domain of interest.
