# REINFORCE

REINFORCE is a Monte Carlo variant of policy gradient methods. It uses the complete return from each state-action pair to update the policy, which can lead to high variance in the updates. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement but can be inefficient due to its reliance on full episodes for learning.
