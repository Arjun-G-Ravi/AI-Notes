## Reinforcement Learning - a high level overview
`Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning paradigm where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.` The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward over time by discovering a strategy, or policy, that maps from states of the environment to actions.

- You have an agent interacting with the environment. It makes some actions and the environment sends back the reward for that particular action and also the next state of the environment.
- In RL, we don't think in terms of 'good' actions. An action is considered 'good' if it is a part of a good policy (sequence of actions that lead to the goal state).
