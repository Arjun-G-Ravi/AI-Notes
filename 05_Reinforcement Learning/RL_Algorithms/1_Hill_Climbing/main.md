# Hill Clilmbing

Hill climbing is a simple optimization algorithm that iteratively makes small changes to a solution and evaluates the result. If the change improves the solution, it is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected. This process continues until no further improvements can be made.

- It is not a reinforcement learning algorithm in the traditional sense, but it can be used to optimize policies in RL.
