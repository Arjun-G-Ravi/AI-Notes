1. HER(Hindsight Experience Replay):
     - What it is: A technique that allows agents to learn from failed episodes by treating them as if they were successful, using hindsight to adjust the goals.
     - Why it's important: Significantly improves sample efficiency in sparse reward environments.
     - Best for: Environments with sparse rewards or long-horizon tasks where achieving the goal is difficult.
2. Auxiliary Reward Signals:
     - What it is: Additional rewards that guide the agent towards learning useful features or behaviors, often used in conjunction with the main task.
     - Why it's important: Helps in environments where the main reward signal is sparse or delayed.
     - Best for: Complex environments where the main task is difficult to learn directly.
3. Curiosity-Driven Exploration:
     - What it is: Techniques that encourage agents to explore the environment by rewarding them for discovering new states or actions. This is done by predicting the next state or action and rewarding the agent for surprising outcomes.
     - Why it's important: Helps in environments where exploration is crucial for learning but the reward signal is sparse.
     - Best for: Environments with large state spaces and sparse rewards.
