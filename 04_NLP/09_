# Decoder-only Transformer model

A decoder-only model is a type of neural network architecture that consists of a single component, the decoder, which is responsible for generating the output. There is no encoder component that processes the input data before passing it to the decoder.

The original introduction of the transformer had an encoder-decoder architecture, and it was only later that the standard paradigm for causal language model was defined by using only the decoder part of this original architecture.
