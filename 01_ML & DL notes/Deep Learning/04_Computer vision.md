## Object Classification
Classifing the object in an image as one among a lot of classes.

## Object Localisation
Image localization, often referred to as object localization, is a computer vision task that involves identifying and precisely locating one or more objects within an image. The goal is to determine the coordinates or bounding box that delineates the region of interest where the object(s) are located.

## Landmark Detection
Detecting various important landmark in an image. Eg: Posture of a man

## Object Detection
The act of detecting an object and localising it. 

## Sliding Window Detection
One object detection method, where we slide an incresingly bigger window over an image with a very small stride, in the hope to fit the box on the image. But this is very inefficient.

We can implement convolution over this to make this more efficient.
