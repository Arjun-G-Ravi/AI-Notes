### Hypothesis Space:
The hypothesis space refers to the set of all possible hypotheses or candidate models that a machine learning algorithm considers to make predictions or classifications. 

### Version Space
Tthe version space is the subset of the hypothesis space that is still considered plausible or feasible given the available evidence.


### VC Dimension
The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a concept in statistical learning theory and machine learning that measures the capacity or expressive power of a hypothesis class. 

- For a binary classification for m datapoints in n dimension, we have H which is a set of all hypothesis classes. 
- If a hypothesis hâˆˆH can correctly classify all m datapoints in n dimensions, we say that H shatters the dataset. 
- The VC dimension of the hypothesis class H is the maximum number of datapoints that H can shatter.
