## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning paradigm where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward over time by discovering a strategy, or policy, that maps from states of the environment to actions.

In RL, we don't think in terms of 'good' actions. An action is considered 'good' if it is a part of a good policy (sequence of actions that lead to the goal state).

The learning process in reinforcement learning involves the agent exploring different actions in different states, receiving feedback in the form of rewards, and adjusting its policy to improve its decision-making capabilities.

This is like learning with a critic, who gives an occasional thumbs up or thumbs down, as opposed to learning with a teacher, who tells you what to do at each step.
