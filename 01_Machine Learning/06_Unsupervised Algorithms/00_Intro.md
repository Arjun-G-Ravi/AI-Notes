# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning deals with problems in which dataset doesnâ€™t have target labels to predict. These algorithm are generally used to find interesting information about the given dataset.

Generally, there are four unsupervised learning techniques:
- Density estimation
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction 
- Anomaly detection
