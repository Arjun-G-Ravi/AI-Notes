## Text normalization
Text normalization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the process of converting a piece of text into a standardized form. This involves correcting spelling errors, expanding abbreviations and contractions, removing punctuation marks, converting all characters to lowercase or uppercase, and applying other transformations that make the text easier to analyze and compare.

## Tokenisation
Converting text data into tokens.

## Stemming
Reducing words to their base or root form, by chopping off parts of words.
Eg: SnowBallStemmer, PorterStemmer

## Lemmatization
It is stemming performed by consulting the context of the text

## Regular Expression
Formally, a regular expression is an algebraic notation for characterizing a set of strings. Regular expressions are particularly useful for searching in texts, when we have a pattern to search for and a corpus of texts to search through.

To perform regex, we can use the 're' library in python.
