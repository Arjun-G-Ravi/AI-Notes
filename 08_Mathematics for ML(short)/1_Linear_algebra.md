# Linear Algebra

- Basics
  - Scalars, matrices, tensors
    - Transpose
    - Types of matrices
  - `Multiplication`
    - Matrix multiplication
    - Element-wise product(Hadamard product)
  - Inverse of a matrix
  - `Linear Dependence and Independence`
    - Linear combination
  - `Span`: The span represents the set of all vectors that can be reached by scaling and adding the given vectors.
  - `Norm`: It generalizes the concept of "distance from the origin" to higher-dimensional spaces.
    - L2 norm is euclidian distance
    - L1 norm, L (inf) norm 
  - `Eigendecomposition`: Decompose a matrix to eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    - An eigenvector of a square matrix AA is a non-zero vector vv that only gets scaled (not  otherwise transformed) when A is matmul-ed to it. 
    - Formally, vv satisfies the equation: `Av=λv`. Here v is eigenvector and λ is the eigenvalue for that eigenvector.
    - Eigenvector represents the factor by which the eigenvector is stretched or compressed during the transformation.
    -  Geometric Intuition
       -  Eigenvectors indicate the directions in which the transformation A acts as simple scaling (no change in direction).
       -  Eigenvalues specify how much the scaling occurs along these directions.
    - Why do it?
      - Eigen decomposition helps explain how a matrix transforms vectors. 
      - PCA uses it for dimensionality reduction
- `Singular Value Decomposition`
  - powerful matrix factorization technique
  - generalizes eigen decomposition to all matrices, including non-square ones.
- `Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse`
