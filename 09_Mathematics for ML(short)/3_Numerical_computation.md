# Numerical Computation

- Numerical computation problem
  - Overflow
  - Underflow
- Poor Conditioning
- Gradient based optimisations
  - Gradient Descent
  - Jacobian matrix(a matrix containing the partial deriviatives to all directions), Hessian matrices(just like jacobian, but with second degree partial derivatives)
- Constrained optimisations
- Linear Least Squares
