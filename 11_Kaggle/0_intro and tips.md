# Tips for Kaggle Competitions
- Add topic specific knowlege to your model.
- Use public features and models that are already available in discussion forums.
- Have a base stucture which will let you quickly add new features and models and ensemble them with your existing models.
- Validation Strategy
- (Most of the times) Only Boosted Trees and Neural Networks wins in Kaggle competitions.
- csv files can lose precision, so use pickle files to save your models.
- AutoML tools can be used to quickly get a baseline model, but they might not always yield the best results.

# Important Skills
- Data Preprocessing and Visualization (to identify patterns and anomalies for feature engineering)
- Feature Engineering (more important than the model)
- Model Ensembling
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Validation
