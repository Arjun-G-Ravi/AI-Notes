# Correlation Matrix
A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between variables. Each cell in the table represents the correlation between two variables. Correlation measures the strength and direction of a **linear** relationship between two variables.

- Corr=1: Perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other also increases proportionally).
- Corr=âˆ’1: Perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases proportionally).
- Corr=0: No linear correlation.

`Just because Corr of two variables is zero, doesn't mean that they are unrelated. They can have a NON-LINEAR relationship.`

It can be used in pandas using df.corr().
