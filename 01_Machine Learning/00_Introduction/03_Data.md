# Data
The quality and nature of the training data are critical components of a learned model's success, alongside the development of effective models and algorithms. Thus the quality and quanity of the dataset play a huge role in the quality of the ML model created.

# Common datasets

## Image datasets
1. MNIST (V. simple)
2. Fashion-MNIST (Simple)
3. CIFAR (A bit more complex)
4. ImageNet (Complex)

# Text datasets
1. IMDB movie review dataset (Sentiment analysis)
2. Workshop on Machine Translation(WMT) dataset (Machine Translation)
3. SQuAD (question answering)


# Note
- Differnt model work with different quantity and types of data

### Quantity:
More data generally leads to better performance, but the law of diminishing returns applies. It also depends on the type of model and the task.
Eg: NNs are very data hungry, while decision trees can work well with less data.

### Type:
Different models may require different types of data.
Eg: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are typically used for image data, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers are used for sequential data like text.
