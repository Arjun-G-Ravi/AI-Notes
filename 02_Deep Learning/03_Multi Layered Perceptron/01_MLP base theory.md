# MLP
They are feedforward fully connected artificial neural networks. 
They are the most basic NN architecture.

# Notes
- Usually we don't count the input layer as layer. So the image shows a 4 layered neural network. -
- The perceptron learning algorithm is the first optmisation algorithm for NNs. It works only if the training data is linearly separable
- MLPs are universal approximators - can approximate any function
