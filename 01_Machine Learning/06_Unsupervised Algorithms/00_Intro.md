# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning deals with problems in which dataset doesn’t have target labels to predict. These algorithm are generally used to find interesting information about the given dataset.

Some unsupervised learning techniques are:
- Density estimation
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction (discovering latent “factors of variation”)
- Anomaly detection
- Self-supervised learning
