Whenever using ML to solve a problem:

    0) Import, dataset and dataloaders creation, device definition
    1) Design the model (the forward pass), the input size and output size
    2) Construct loss and the optimiser
    3) Training loop
         - Forward pass: Compute prediction [inference]
         - Backward pass: Gradients (auto gradient for last one)
         - Compute loss for accuracy check
         - Update weights
    4) Predict output and calculate accuracy (use torch.no_grad())
