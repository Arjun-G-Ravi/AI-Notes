# Cross Entropy Method (CEM)

CEM is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policies by sampling from a distribution and updating the parameters based on the best-performing samples. It is particularly useful for high-dimensional action spaces and can be applied to both discrete and continuous action spaces.

Just like Hill Climbing, CEM is not a traditional RL algorithm but can be used to optimize policies in RL. It is a black-box optimization method that does not require knowledge of the environment's dynamics.
